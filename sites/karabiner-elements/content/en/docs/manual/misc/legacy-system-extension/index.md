The following alert will be shown on macOS Catalina because Karabiner-Elements 12.x.x or earlier use kernel extension (aka legacy system extension) in order to provide virtual keyboard and pointing device.

We are working to migrate to a newer mechanism, DriverKit, from kernel extension and we plan to support it at Karabiner-Elements 13.0.0.
