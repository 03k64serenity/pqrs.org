If you faced a problem and you want to revert previous version, please downgrade Karabiner-Elements as follows.

1.  [Uninstall Karabiner-Elements from uninstaller](../uninstall/).
2.  [Download a previous version from here](../../../releasenotes/).
3.  Install again.

The first uninstallation is required to remove the virtual driver.
Since virtual drivers cannot be directly downgraded, if you want to install an older version, you need to remove a newer version beforehand.
