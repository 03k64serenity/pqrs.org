It's a hardware limitation of your keyboard called "two-key rollover" if you cannot use some three key combinations.
(e.g., `physical left command key + right command key + m`)

There are two way to avoid the rollover problem.

-   Use another hardware which is N-key rollover.
-   Use other key combinations.
