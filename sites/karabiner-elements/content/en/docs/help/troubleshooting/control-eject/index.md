It's an issue of macOS, and unfortunately, Karabiner-Elements cannot avoid this issue.<br />
Instead, please change fn+escape to eject and use control+fn+escape (== control+eject) shortcut.

1.  Import [Change escape key](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#escape).
2.  Enable **Change fn+escape to eject**.<br />
    You can use control+fn+escape as control+eject.
