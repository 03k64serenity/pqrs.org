Karabiner-Elements does not control the caps lock LED for non Apple keyboards by default in order to avoid a macOS deadlock issue at turning LED on with some devices which does not have the caps lock LED.

If you are using non Apple keyboards and you want to use caps lock LED, please turn on `Manipulate LED` checkbox.
